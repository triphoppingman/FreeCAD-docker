# FreeCAD-docker
A copy of the linuxserver-orcaslicer codebase.

## Introduction
A shameless copy of the work some by 'TheLamer' (Ryan K) from linuxserver.io on the orcaslicer docker image for FreeCAD.   This is an application container that presents the freecad application in a container, 'projected'
by VNC into a browser window.   This is part of my toolset for 3D printing and CNC work.
